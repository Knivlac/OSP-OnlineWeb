                  Are you tired of trying but failing to move past experiences
                  and relationships that have caused hurt or confusion? Are you
                  caught in a cycle of repeating old behaviors that don't work?
                  Are you frustrated and ready for something to give? "Get over
                  it!" is often perceived as a derogatory way to express
                  frustration or exhaustion. However, this book flips the phrase
                  on its head and offers a positive and encouraging message,
                  making these the nicest mean words you'll ever hear or say.
                  Author Sally Livingston uses her psychotherapy and ministry
                  leadership experience to show how it is actually possible to
                  interrupt the Stuck Cycle and work the steps to make
                  substantial change. When you follow this process you will
                  encounter freedom on the other side of your it.
