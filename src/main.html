                        <p>Are you tired of trying but failing to move past experiences and relationships that have caused hurt or confusion? Are you caught in a cycle of repeating old behaviors that don't work? Are you frustrated and ready for something to give? "Get over it!" is often perceived as a derogatory way to express frustration or exhaustion. However, this book flips the phrase on its head and offers a positive and encouraging message, making these the nicest mean words you'll ever hear or say. Author Sally Livingston uses her psychotherapy and ministry leadership experience to show how it is actually possible to interrupt the Stuck Cycle and work the steps to make substantial change. When you follow this process you will encounter freedom on the other side of your it.
