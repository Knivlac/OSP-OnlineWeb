# OSP-OnlineWeb 🔰

🏫 This is a school project for our Open Source class. 💻 

The goal of our project is to create a simple website, an online shop website which will feature a simple landing page that will display a catalogue of products to the users or customers. There will also be a log in function for the user and the admin. Users of the website will be able to browse through the list of products.

In the System adminstrator's side, the administrator's role is to maintain the web server services and managing the website from the price changes to adding and removing items on sale. Optionally if we have enough time, we will add a checkout function for the user in form of a cart function and keeping the purchase history in the backend.
      
For the database side, user and admin information will be recorded for the login. There will also be another table for products. The data comprised in users table will include user ID, name, password, e-mail. The data in the product table will include the product ID, product name, product type. For the optional function, we will be adding tables that keep track of user purchases and a cart table allowing the user to bulk checkout.
