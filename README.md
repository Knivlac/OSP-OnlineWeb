# OSP-OnlineWeb 🔰

🏫 This is a school project for our Open Source class. 💻

Our project aims to develop a simple online bookstore website, featuring a simple landing page displaying a book catalog to webpage visitors. In addition to the book listings, the website will have “About Us” and “FAQ” sections to provide information about the bookstore.

Users visiting the website will be able to browse through the list of available books, while only registered users will have the privilege to make purchases. To facilitate this, we will implement sign-up and login functionalities.

On the administrative side, the system administrators will have the role of managing various aspects of the inventory of books and the roster of website users. They will have access to these functionalities from the administrative interface.

The backend development will involve the utilization of PHP, JavaScript, and SQL (SQLite or MySQL syntax) to establish communication between the website and the database. It will handle functions such as sign-up and login systems, managing displayed items, handling user access, and so forth.

In terms of the database structure, we shall uphold the discerning information of users and administrators by preserving distinct tables for each role. These tables will capture vital data such as usernames and login hashes for users, and admin IDs and login hashes for administrators. Moreover, another table shall store book-related particulars, encompassing essential elements such as ISBN, book cover image file name, title, author, genre, price, and description (book synopsis). 

Unfortunately, due to inadequate time, further advanced functionalities may regrettably be excluded from the project scope. Perchance, should time permit, we also plan the integration of shopping cart and purchase history features on our website.
